                    <p>Being the neighborhood I had grew up in and ever since cherished due to its diversity in the community there, I would recommend Sunset Park as a place to go to if you just want to see a vast amount of festivities and cultural events.</p>

                    <p>Although this place is quite crowded and noisy pretty much every day, Canal Street's Chinatown is really a place where you can see the Chinese culture and people around every street corner.</p>

                    <p>Finally, the iconic NYC tourist attraction alongside the Statue of Liberty. This place, like Chinatown, is pretty much crowded. However, the views of the skyscrapers and billboards are amazing. Beware of the witty salespeople (especially in costumes), however.</p>
